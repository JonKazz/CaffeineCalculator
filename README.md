**CaffeineCalculator** Named in honor of our 36 hours of coding is a web app built in React
It features a frontend that sends api requests to a backend build with actix in Rust. 
The main purpose of the app is to act as a bridge between high end mathematics software and easy to use command line interfaces.
The input to the calculator is in the form of cli commands. The original goal is to have the algorithm solve complex math equations while providing the steps and proofs used in the process. So far it is capable of calculations involving all of the standard operators both unary and binary. We utilize an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and a lexical tokenizer to construct the raw input into meaningful data. The AST evaluates any number of operators at one time while following mathematical conventions. We even added a graphing tool which we hope to expand to 3D in the future. For code quality, we have heavy redundance in error handeling to prevent the program from crashing. In the future we hope to add more functionality such as multi-integral visualization, derivatives, machine learning operations, and tensors.
